# Description

An AI chatbot with Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a system that can understand, interpret, and generate human language. Using NLP techniques like tokenization, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition, it processes user input and responds accordingly. Such chatbots can handle a variety of tasks, from simple queries to complex conversations, by analyzing and understanding context, intent, and meaning in the text. They are widely used in customer support, virtual assistants, e-commerce, and more, offering interactive, personalized, and efficient communication.
1. Imports and Setup:

The script imports necessary components from nltk.chat.util and downloads the punkt tokenizer.

2. Pattern-Response Pairs:

The pairs list defines regular expression patterns that match user inputs and corresponding responses. For example:
Greeting words like "hi", "hello", and "hey" trigger a greeting response.
If the user mentions their name, the bot responds with a personalized message.

3. Chatbot Instance:

A Chat instance is created using the pairs and reflections (which helps map pronouns like "I" to "you").

4. Chat Function:

The chat() function starts an interactive conversation loop, where the bot responds to user input. The conversation continues until the user types "quit", "exit", or "bye".
